# Project Title: Coefficient of Variation to Assess the Reproducibility of Meal-Induced Glycemic Responses

## Description 

Managing Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) requires maintaining target blood glucose levels through precise diet and insulin dosing. Predicting postprandial glycemic responses (PPGRs) based solely on carbohydrate content is limited by factors like meal composition, individual physiology, and lifestyle. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) provide insights into these responses, revealing significant individual variability. The statistical clustering method proposed here balances the number of clusters formed and the glycemic variability of the PPGRs within each cluster to offer a clustering technique on which treatment decisions could be based.
